/*Closures are created whenever a variable that is defined outside the current scope is accessed from within some inner scope.
It gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created.
To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it.*/
