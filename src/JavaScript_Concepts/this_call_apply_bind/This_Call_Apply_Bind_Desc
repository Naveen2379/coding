you can use call()/apply() to invoke the function immediately. bind() returns a bound function that, when executed later, will have the correct context('this')
for calling the original function. So bind() can be used when the function needs to be called later.

Apply and Call are nearly identical and are frequently used in JavaScript for borrowing methods and for setting the this value explicitly.
we use Bind for setting the this value in methods and for currying functions (currying function, also known as partial function application,
is the use of a function (that accept one or more arguments) that returns a new function with some of the arguments already set).

bind() added in ECMAScript15
