The Promise object represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an async operation and its resulting value.

Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.

The then() method returns a Promise. It takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise
p.then(onFulfilled[, onRejected]);
p.then(value => {
  // fulfillment
}, reason => {
  // rejection
});

onFulfilled -A Function is called if the Promise is fulfilled. This function has one argument, the fullfilment value.
onRejected  -A Function is called if the Promise is rejected. This function has one argument, the rejection reason.
