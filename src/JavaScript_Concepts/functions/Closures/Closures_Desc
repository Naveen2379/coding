* Closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JS, closures are created every time a function is created,
* at function creation time.



* functions in JavaScript form closures. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
* This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.
