* Web Socket Latency

Which of the following statements regarding latency of web sockets compared to other protocols are true?
Pick all that apply
If you need to get just a single message from a server, HTTP will be slightly slower than Web Sockets because of the connection set-up time in HTTP is much worse than in Web Sockets
If you need to get a number of messages from a server, over a long period of time, Web Socket will give much lower latency compared to HTTP for all except the first message
For unidirectional communication from the server to the client, Web Sockets and Server-Sent events will have similar latencies for all except the first message
For bi-directional communication between the server and client, Web Sockets and Server-Sent events will have similar latencies for all except the first message
Compared to messages over TCP sockets, Web Sockets will be faster because they use UDP
