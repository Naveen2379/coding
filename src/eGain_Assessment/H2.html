Currently, the div.content2 is overlapping div.content1 and hiding part of it. We would like div.content1 to be fully visible, and the overlapping parts of div.content2 to be hidden behind it. Which of the following changes will achieve this? Note: other than the stacking of div.content1 and div.content2 nothing else about the layout of the page should change?
Pick all that apply
Adding z-index: 2; to the properties of .content1
Adding position: relative; z-index: 2; to the properties of .content1
Adding z-index: -1; to the properties of .content2 without making any changes to the properties of .content1
Adding order: 2; to the properties of .content1 and adding order: 1; to the properties of .content2
None of the above
