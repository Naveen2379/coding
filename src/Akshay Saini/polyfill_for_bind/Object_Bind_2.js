/* The method setTimeout in-browser is a little special: it sets this=window for the function call (for Node.js, this becomes the timer object,
but doesnâ€™t really matter here). So for this.firstName it tries to get window.firstName, which does not exist. In other similar cases,
usually this just becomes undefined.*/
